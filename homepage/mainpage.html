        <h3>OVERVIEW:</h3>
        <p>
            This project is intended to create a Library database system for users in a College. This project intends to create a database
            where students are able to register in the system, search for books and check them out. Additionally, our database should also allow
            Librarians to create accounts here and manage the database. They can perform the same functionalities as the student but they are given some additional
            functionalities as well. Overall, our goal in this project was to replicate a real life library database where students and librarians can interact with
            our database and register as users.
        </p>
        <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
        <p>
            Our library database consists of 4 entities in total: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>BOOK:</span> We have a BOOK entity. The book entity primarily stores information on each book, e.g. Title, author
                    , release date, ISBN etc. Every tuple in this entry denotes a singular book with all of its important information.</li>
                <li><span>MEMBER:</span> We have a MEMBER entity. The member entity stores information on each member such as their name, DOB, Member ID,
                    username, password and if they are a student or a librarian etc. Every tuple in this entry denotes one unique user with all their
                    identifying information.</li>
                <li><span>CHECKOUT_STATUS</span> This entity contains information on every book that has been checked out to different users.
                    Each tuple in this entity represents 1 book that has been checked out to a user. We have different attributes that help us
                    identify who checked out which book. It contains a foreign key which references MemberID in entity MEMBER, and another foreign
                    key which references ISBN in BOOK. Collectively, they help create 1 entire checkout of a book. There are other attributes that provide
                    more information on the checkout status such as checkout_date which represents the day the book was checked out and due_date which
                    represents the day the book was/is due. These are just some attributes among others.</li>
                <li><span>VIEWS</span> This entity keeps information on each user's interaction with the books. This entity is relatively simple but it references
                    the same two foreign keys that CHECKOUT_STATUS references, namely MemberID from entity MEMBER and ISBN from entity BOOK. Each tuple in VIEWS
                    represents an access to any of the book and information regarding that access. Each tuple can tell us accessor's MemberID and ISBN of the book,
                    the date they first accessed that book, the day they last accessed that book and the page number they last accessed. This also means that there might
                    be members in MEMBER that do not appear here, for example if a user creates an account but never accesses any book at all.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>MEMBERS' CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>
